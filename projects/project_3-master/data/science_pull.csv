857,1586352143,science,"Hi reddit! We’re an international team of researchers working to understand the microbiology of how the novel coronavirus infects and takes over healthy cells, in order to interrupt the infection and transmission processes with drugs. 

The Krogan Lab at UCSF has already identified more than 300 human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 during infection, and created an “interactome” showing how human proteins cooperate with viral ones. Blocking these interactions may prevent the virus from making copies of itself, thereby slowing down both infection and transmission. 

On today’s panel we have: 

*Nevan Krogan, PhD*: I’m a professor and the director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF and a Senior Investigator at the Gladstone Institutes. I led the work to create the SARS-CoV-2 interactome and assembled the QBI Coronavirus Research Group (QCRG), which includes hundreds of scientists from around the world. My research focuses on developing and using unbiased, quantitative systems approaches to study a wide variety of diseases with the ultimate goal of developing new therapeutics. 

*Kevan Shokat, PhD*: I’m a UCSF professor of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and an expert in drug design. In my role on the QCRG, my lab at UCSF is combing through existing FDA-approved drugs and clinical trial databases to find candidates that match up well with the human host proteins shown to interact with SARS-CoV-2, and may therefore block the actions of the virus.

*John Young, PhD*: I'm a virologist by training and the Global Head of Infectious Diseases at Roche Pharma Research and Early Development in Basel, Switzerland. I oversee infectious disease research and early clinical development programs. I'm collaborating with Krogan’s team to characterize the interactions between the virus and cellular proteins with the goal of identifying new therapeutic approaches.

Please do not submit anything like that.


**This year we are doing something a little different though! Our mods and flaired users have an enormous about of expertise on an incredibly wide variety of scientific topics. This year, we are giving our readers a chance to Ask Us Anything!**

*How it works*- if you have flair on r/science, and want to participate, post a top-level comment describing your expertise/area of research. All comments below that are effectively your own personal AMA. Readers, feel free to ask our team of experts anything (usual rules that comments must be polite and appropriate still hold)! Any top level comments that are not in the AMA style (eg ""I'm a PhD student working on CRISPR in zebrafish, ask me anything!"") will be removed, as will top level comments from users without flair or that claim expertise that is not reflected by the flair.
______________________

Further, if you've completed a degree, consider getting flair in r/science through our *Science Verified User Program*.

r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic.

What flair is available?

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar. However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of Biology is tagged as such (Professor | Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as ""Grad Student | Biology."" Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even, on occasion, music. It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:
Level of education | Field | Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.
How does one obtain flair?

First, have a college degree or higher.

Next, send an email with your information to redditscienceflair@gmail.com with information that establishes your claim. This can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. 

Please include the following information:

Username:

Flair text: Degree level | Degree area | Speciality

Flair class:

for example:

Username: p1percub, Flair text: Professor | Human Genetics | Computational Trait Analysis, Flair Class: bio

Due to limitations of time (mods are volunteers) it may take a few days for you flair to be assigned (we're working on it!).

This email address is restricted access, and only mods which actively assign user flair may log in. All information will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. For added security, you may submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification.
Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture (for example, have your username written on a slip of paper and visible in the photo).

What is expected of a verified account?

We expect a higher level of conduct than a non-verified account, if another user makes inappropriate comments they should report them to the mods who will take appropriate action.
